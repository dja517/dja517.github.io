# üß† AI Emotion Detection Web App

## Overview

This demo project simulates a real-world scenario where I acted as a software engineer tasked with building a web app capable of detecting human emotions from text. I used IBM's Watson NLP library and followed a full-stack development workflow ‚Äî from setup and deployment to testing and packaging.

---

## Project Workflow

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Clone Project Repository

Cloned the starter project repo as the foundation for development. Verified environment setup and ensured Watson NLP dependencies were installed properly.

---

### üòÑ Task 2: Build Emotion Detection Logic

Used **IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to extract emotional tones from user-input text. Mapped NLP response data to human-readable emotions like *joy*, *anger*, *sadness*, and *fear*.

---

### üßæ Task 3: Format Output

Designed clean and readable emotion output using Flask templates. Responses display emotion name, confidence score, and color-coded feedback for better UX.

---

### üì¶ Task 4: Package Application

Packaged the app using Python packaging conventions to allow easy deployment and testing. Created `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, and virtual environment configs.

---

### üß™ Task 5: Unit Testing

Wrote unit tests to validate key logic in the emotion classification pipeline. Ensured the app handles both valid and malformed input gracefully.

---

### üåê Task 6: Web Deployment Using Flask

Deployed the app locally using Flask. Handled routing, frontend display, and server-side logic. Validated the full user flow from input to NLP processing and response rendering.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 7: Error Handling

Implemented input validation and custom error messages. Handled edge cases such as empty text, API errors, and connection issues without crashing the app.

---

### üßπ Task 8: Static Code Analysis

Performed static code checks using tools like `pylint` or `flake8` to ensure code quality, consistency, and readability.

---

## Key Outcomes

- **Developed an NLP-Powered Web App from Scratch**  
  Integrated IBM Watson NLU into a Flask web application with proper architecture.

- **Validated, Tested, and Hardened Code**  
  Ensured app stability with unit tests, error handling, and static analysis.

- **Deployed a Complete End-to-End AI Solution**  
  Built and packaged a full-stack AI application ready for deployment.
