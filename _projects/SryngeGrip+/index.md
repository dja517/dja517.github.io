# Project Details 

## What is a SyringeGrip?

The SyringeGrip was developed to address usability challenges in controlled dispensing scenarios, especially where precision and repeatability are critical. The core goal was to create a stable yet adaptive interface for standard BD syringes.

## Problem

- **Inconsistent Fit Across Users**  
  Users with different finger sizes struggled with the one-size-fits-all grip, leading to discomfort and reduced control.

- **Manufacturing Variance in Syringes**  
  BD syringes manufactured in different regions showed slight variations in outer diameter. The original design compensated with a looser fit, sacrificing stability.

## Key Improvements

- **Clinically Informed Design**  
  Collaborated with a medical professional to gather user feedback and tune ergonomic refinements.

- **Spec-Driven Fit Optimization**  
  Studied manufacturer specifications (BD, Terumo, Glatopa) to design around real-world tolerances.

- **Adaptive Geometry**  
  Introduced crush ribs and improved contouring to maintain a  self-aligning fit without compromising universal compatibility.
