# SwiftAuto Traders – Sales & Profit Analysis

## Overview
 The goal was to evaluate dealership performance using sales and profit data, and present insights through charts and dashboards.

---

## Part 1 – Excel Visualization

I explored dealership trends and profitability by creating the following visualizations in Excel:

- **Bar Chart:** Quantity Sold by Dealer ID (sorted)
- **Line Chart:** Profit by Date and Model
- **Column Chart:** Profit by Year and Dealer ID
- **Line Chart:** Sum of Profits for *Hudson* model by Dealer ID

## Part 2 – Dashboard Design

Created an interactive dashboard using **Cognos Analytics** *(or Looker Studio)* with two focused report pages: **Sales** and **Service**.
