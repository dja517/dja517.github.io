# SyringeGrip Project

## Design Process

The SyringeGrip was developed to address usability challenges in controlled dispensing scenarios, especially where precision and repeatability are critical. The core goal was to create a stable yet adaptive interface for standard BD syringes.

### Key Design Choices

- **Designed for BD compatibility**  
  Early in the process, I reviewed **BD's syringe specification sheets** to ensure dimensional compatibility and tolerances. This influenced not only the grip's form factor but also dictated clearance margins.

- **Incorporating crush ribs for alignment**  
  I integrated **crush ribs** at critical contact points. These provided:  
  - A self-centering fit  
  - Tolerance for **small variances in barrel diameter**  
  - Reduction in part complexity by avoiding secondary fastening

- **Material selection**  
  Used a flexible PLA prototype initially, then shifted to a more rigid PETG for **better force transfer** without permanent deformation.

- **Testing for ergonomic use**  
  Simulated repeated use by different users to refine grip contours and improve **comfort over long sessions**.

### Functionality & Use

Once assembled, the grip allowed for consistent **one-handed operation** and reduced variability in applied pressure. The final form factor was tested with both 5mL and 10mL BD syringes to confirm the universal fit strategy worked.

### Lessons & Reflections

> “Designing with tolerances in mind was key — even a perfect 3D model fails if real-world variation isn’t considered.”

Working with real-world standards and design constraints forced a more disciplined, **engineering-focused approach**, blending usability with reliability.
