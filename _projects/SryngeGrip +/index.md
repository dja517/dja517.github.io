title: SyringeGrip+
description: 
    Redesigned commercial SyringeGrip to accommodate variations in hand size and syringe diameter tolerances. Integrated adaptive relief features such as crush ribs and grip fins to ensure compatibility across multiple syringe brands (BD, Terumo, Glatopa). Design was tested and approved by a medical clinic

# SyringeGrip Project

## Design Process

The SyringeGrip was developed to address usability challenges in controlled dispensing scenarios, especially where precision and repeatability are critical. The core goal was to create a stable yet adaptive interface for standard BD syringes.

## Problem

- **Inconsistent Fit Across Users**  
  Users with different finger sizes struggled with the one-size-fits-all grip, leading to discomfort and reduced control.

- **Manufacturing Variance in Syringes**  
  BD syringes manufactured in different regions showed slight variations in outer diameter. The original design compensated with a looser fit, sacrificing stability.

## Key Improvements

- **Clinically Informed Design**  
  Collaborated with a medical professional to gather user feedback and tune ergonomic refinements.

- **Spec-Driven Fit Optimization**  
  Studied manufacturer specifications (BD, Terumo, Glatopa) to design around real-world tolerances.

- **Adaptive Geometry**  
  Introduced crush ribs and improved contouring to maintain a  self-aligning fit without compromising universal compatibility.
